# Components

For small components, there is the `./src/sass/components` folder. While `.src/sass/layout` is macro (defining the global wireframe), `/components` is more focused on widgets. It contains all kind of specific modules like a slider, a loader, a widget, and basically anything along those lines. There are usually a lot of files in components/ since the whole site/application should be mostly composed of tiny modules.

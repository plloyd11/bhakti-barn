            Betsy Davis is the founder/co-owner and principal teacher of Bhakti Barn Yoga in Millburn, and Glen Ridge
            New Jersey, which are vibrant havens for yogis for the past 9 years. Betsy has been teaching yoga for 19
            years and practicing yoga for over 20 years. Betsy began her yoga studies with Dana Flynn and Jasmine
            Tarkeshi of Laughing Lotus NYC and was a senior teacher at Laughing Lotus NYC for 12 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Betsy’s teachings offer an experience of yoga that includes mudra, mantra, pranayama, asana, and yoga
            philosophy that is infused with a mind-full awareness of alignment. She incorporates music and poetry for a
            transformative and uplifting experience. Her classes are filled with creative and playful movement, which
            acts as a bridge to deeper union with the self and the moment, on the path to liberation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Betsy is also a painter and ran a decorative painting business and set painting/backdrop business out of New

            "I first found yoga when, like so many, I was drawn to the physical benefits: general well-being, strength, flexibility.  What I found was so much more- yoga offers me a system for clearing space in my body-mind, helping me to see myself and the world more clearly. With a strong desire to share what I had found, and to facilitate well-being in others, I began my teaching journey.  I’ve been teaching for over a decade, offering Vinyasa flow, Fundamentals of yoga, Gentle yoga, Chair yoga, and Pranayama (yogic breathwork). 
          </p>
          <p>I offer precise and detailed instruction, focusing on helping people to find the poses in their own bodies rather than fitting their bodies to some imagined ideal shape.  You’ll experience sensible, intelligent sequencing to guide you on your journey throughout class. </p>
          <p>In addition to sharing classes and workshops with students, I have a passion for teaching teachers.  I enjoy leading 200 hour trainings and for years have mentored 200 and 300 hour teacher trainees through their trainings.  I have been a guest teacher of Pranayama, Asana, Chair yoga, and Chakras in 200 and 300 hour trainings.</p>
          <p>
            I am forever grateful to Betsy Davis (Betsy-ma!) for her generosity and for creating a loving home in Bhakti Barn."

            <p class="has-text-white">
              The education and inspiration that I was blessed with at Bhakti Barn under the loving guide of Betsy
              Davis, RYT was truly beyond measure. Bhakti Barn is an elite yoga school. The guest teachers were the best
              in the field, devoted to their honed in craft and were easy to be with and full of knowledge. Betsy was
              available for anything… any inquiry, any issue, or even just a hug, throughout the entire training, and
              continues to be a source of friendship and light. Bhakti Barn remains a grounding space, a sacred space,
              to expand my yoga practice and my inner light. Eternally grateful for the experience. Highly recommend!

              The training I received at The Bhakti Barn was amazing. All of the classes are taken seriously and have
              with them an atmosphere of genuine care and devotion. The camaraderie between myself and fellow classmates
              was more of a family than a group of strangers seeking out on their own separate quests. And that
              environment was created and nurtured by Betsy and her incredibly talented staff. I'm ready now more than
              ever to take my practice to the next level and I have everyone at The Bhakti Barn to thank for that. XO

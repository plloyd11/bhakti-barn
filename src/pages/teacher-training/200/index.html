                        Betsy Davis is the founder/co-owner and principal teacher of Bhakti Barn Yoga in Millburn, and Glen Ridge New Jersey, which are vibrant havens for
                        yogis for the past 9 years. Betsy has been teaching yoga for 19 years and practicing yoga for over 20 years. Betsy began her yoga studies with
                        Dana Flynn and Jasmine Tarkeshi of Laughing Lotus NYC and was a senior teacher at Laughing Lotus NYC for 12 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Betsy’s teachings offer an experience of yoga that includes mudra, mantra, pranayama, asana, and yoga philosophy that is infused with a mind-full
                        awareness of alignment. She incorporates music and poetry for a transformative and uplifting experience. Her classes are filled with creative and
                        playful movement, which acts as a bridge to deeper union with the self and the moment, on the path to liberation.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        through her love of movement, the Earth and all that takes our breath away. Lauren leads a thoughtful and challenging class, diving deeper into
                        the practice through peak poses and a sense of Lila, Divine play. Lauren bows down to her beloved teachers Dana, Jasmine and to her son Gavin. May

                            The education and inspiration that I was blessed with at Bhakti Barn under the loving guide of Betsy Davis, RYT was truly beyond measure.
                            Bhakti Barn is an elite yoga school. The guest teachers were the best in the field, devoted to their honed in craft and were easy to be with
                            and full of knowledge. Betsy was available for anything… any inquiry, any issue, or even just a hug, throughout the entire training, and
                            continues to be a source of friendship and light. Bhakti Barn remains a grounding space, a sacred space, to expand my yoga practice and my
                            inner light. Eternally grateful for the experience. Highly recommend!

                            The training I received at The Bhakti Barn was amazing. All of the classes are taken seriously and have with them an atmosphere of genuine care
                            and devotion. The camaraderie between myself and fellow classmates was more of a family than a group of strangers seeking out on their own
                            separate quests. And that environment was created and nurtured by Betsy and her incredibly talented staff. I'm ready now more than ever to
                            take my practice to the next level and I have everyone at The Bhakti Barn to thank for that. XO

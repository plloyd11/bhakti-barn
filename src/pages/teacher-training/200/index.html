                        <p class="has-text-white">The education and inspiration that I was blessed with at Bhakti Barn under the loving guide of Betsy Davis, RYT was truly beyond measure. Bhakti Barn is an elite yoga school. The guest teachers were the best in the field, devoted to their honed in craft and were easy to be with and full of knowledge. Betsy was available for anything… any inquiry, any issue, or even just a hug, throughout the entire training, and continues to be a source of friendship and light. Bhakti Barn remains a grounding space, a sacred space, to expand my yoga practice and my inner light. Eternally grateful for the experience. Highly recommend!</p>

                        <p class="has-text-white">The training I received at The Bhakti Barn was amazing. All of the classes are takenseriously and have with them an atmosphere of genuine care and devotion. The camaraderie between myself and fellow classmates was more of a family than a group of strangers seeking out on their own separate quests. And that environment was created and nurtured by Betsy and her incredibly talented staff. I'm ready now more than ever to take my practice to the next level and I have everyone at The Bhakti Barn to thank for that. XO</p>

                    <p>
                        Betsy Davis is the founder/co-owner and principal teacher of Bhakti Barn Yoga in Millburn, and Glen Ridge New Jersey, which
                        are vibrant havens for yogis for the past 9 years. Betsy has been teaching yoga for 19 years and practicing yoga for over 20
                        years. Betsy began her yoga studies with Dana Flynn and Jasmine Tarkeshi of Laughing Lotus NYC and was a senior teacher at
                        Laughing Lotus NYC for 12 years.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Betsyâ€™s teachings offer an experience of yoga that includes mudra, mantra, pranayama, asana, and yoga philosophy that is
                        infused with a mind-full awareness of alignment. She incorporates music and poetry for a transformative and uplifting
                        experience. Her classes are filled with creative and playful movement, which acts as a bridge to deeper union with the self
                        and the moment, on the path to liberation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Betsy is also a painter and ran a decorative painting business and set painting/backdrop business out of New York City for 25
                        years! You can see her handy work at the studio through murals and decorative gold-leaf borders.

                                Vanessa’s own yoga journey began in 2003 when, on the eve of her NYU theatrical directorial debut, she was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid
                                Leukemia. Yoga empowered her to play a role in her own healing process. Since returning to health, she’s dedicated herself to educating
                                others and supporting her students’ empowerment through the practice of yoga and meditation.

                                Varrita started her journey of yoga 10 years ago. After finishing a competitive gymnastics career she was left with chronic back and joint
                                pain. Looking for a form a movement that was strong and fluid yet more subtle then gymnastics, she began yoga. Through yoga Varrita
                                learned how to manage her pain and anxiety. This was life changing and opened many doors. Varrita loves teaching movement, she was a
                                competitive gymnastics coach for many years and decided it was time to teach yoga in 2012. Varrita became 200hr certified at Frog Lotus
                                Yoga in Massachusetts. She also received a license in massage therapy, and now specializes in therapeutic Thai yoga massage.

                                It is truer to say Kundalini Yoga found Trish, rather than the other way around. From her first experience in class, Trish knew Kundalini
                                was for her. She loved the music, the meditations and the way it worked for everybody. It felt like coming home. Trish's spiritual name is
                                Ravi Kirtan Kaur and through life's many ups and downs Kundalini has been a stabilizing force for healing, a practice for life.

                            <p>
                                In 2004 Trish got certified to teach at Kundalini Yoga East in NYC under the guidance of Sat Jivan Kaur and Sat Jivan Singh and has been
                                teaching ever since. Trish completed level 2 Mind and Meditation Kundalini training in New Mexico in 2018 and will continue with level 2
                                Stress and Vitality in 2019. Her goal is to complete all five-level 2 trainings. Trish will be forever grateful to Yogi Bhajan for sharing
                                such an uplifting practice and for the loving support of the Kundalini community.

                                When not teaching yoga Trish works as a school nurse in Millburn, enjoys time with her three children and can be found hiking and taking
                                photographs. Trish loves to travel. Find her on Instagram as yogiTrish and Facebook.

                                Tamara Tsoutsouris (EYT-200), completed her 200-hour teacher training at Bhakti Barn Yoga with Betsy Davis and Lauren Magarelli. She
                                continued her training with Dynamic Gentle Yoga guru Rudy Pierce, and has taken advanced anatomy training with Chris Loebsack, and

                                Yoga. In addition to teaching Basic yoga and Vinyasa yoga, she also teaches Chair yoga for seniors, Gentle yoga, and preschool yoga. She
                                is a professional classical singer, and brings a deep awareness of the importance of the breath to her teaching and her practice.

                                "I came to yoga, like so many, for the physical benefits- strength, flexibility, general well-being. What I found was so much more- a way
                                of seeing myself and the world more clearly, a way to calm and still my mind. Yoga has helped me link mind, body, and spirit, using the
                                breath. It provides a system for clearing space- both in the body and in the mind. I am forever grateful to Betsy Davis (Betsy-ma!) for
                                her generosity and for creating a loving home in Bhakti Barn.”

                                One of Steve’s earliest encounters with these sacred practices came at a very young age. As a child, his favorite movie was the Teenage
                                Mutant Ninja Turtles. In it, there are scenes when the Turtles sit and meditate, and although the movie is full of action and adventure,
                                these scenes captured a deeper part of his attention and curiosity. Seeds were planted, and only when he began practicing meditation
                                almost 20 years later, did he realize that he’d been storing them in the depths of his mind since childhood, and now was the time to
                                cultivate. After a few months of meditation practice, sitting comfortably was, well…not so comfortable. At this time, Steve’s study of
                                eastern philosophy was burgeoning and through this study he noticed that yoga was also mentioned quite frequently along with meditation.
                                It was clear that this was the next step and before long he began taking classes at Naturally Yoga in Glen Rock, NJ.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Since then, he has studied in the traditions of Intergral Yoga, Iyengar, and Ashtanga yoga, infusing all three into his personal practice
                                and always keeping meditation as the cornerstone. In 2016, he completed his 200 hour teacher training at Naturally Yoga and considers
                                Veronica Yacco, Neil and Sheryl Edsall as the well springs from which he has been blessed with these teachings. Steve believes that in
                                this life, the body and mind are the instruments with which we’ve been given to perform, and yogic practices are how we tune them.

                                when a trusted teacher recommended it to help keep her active and mindful while healing her various dance injuries. After one class she

                                also completed various additional trainings including Aerial Yoga certification from OM factory NYC and Kids yoga modules from Grounded
                                Kids Yoga. She is constantly striving to hone not only her own personal practice, but also her skills as an educator/communicator while
                                honoring Yogas historic roots. She thoroughly believes in the healing and strengthening powers the introspection of yoga can provide, and
                                she is thrilled to be able to share her love of this practice with the community!

                                Magda was introduced to yoga at a young age by her family and has been going classes and kirtans ever since. She dove deeper into her
                                practice in 2010 to find anxiety relief from the stresses and pressures of daily life. Once she found the benefits of bringing breath and
                                movement into the body she could never look back. Her classes include mindful alignment with a playful sequence of poses. She strives to
                                make each class unique and help every body experience yoga to their fullest potential: the mind, body, and spirit connection.

                                training restorative yoga practice made big impression and I completed Level 1 and 2 under Jamie Lynn Skolnick of Laughing Lotus Yoga NY.
                                I believe that practice of yoga brings joy and should be accessible to all who wish to participate. Gentle yoga was logical next step and
                                I took training with Stephanie Haberman in Bhakti Barn yoga. Also, I completed training in Yin Yoga. The correct dose of everything to
                                create joy and satisfaction what I try to bring into each class. I am grateful to Betsy Davis, Stephanie Haberman and Stacy Anuttara

                                Debby Kaminsky is a former advertising executive who decided in 2006 she wanted to sell the benefits of transformation. She took her first
                                yoga class in 1997 while her twins were in pre-school. Feeling great, she never turned back, becoming a yoga instructor in 2004 through a
                                500-hour certification at the Samudra School of Living Yoga with her friend and yoga guide, Shiva Rea.

                                Her passion is helping to manifest positive change, especially in children. In 2009, she founded Newark Yoga Movement, a 501c3 that has
                                shared important self-regulating life skills through important breathing and yoga with 32,000+ students, 5000+ educators, and the Newark
                                community, including firefighters. She also teaches Veterans yoga through Kula for Karma with the honor of bringing yoga to all armed
                                services personnel in NJ returning from serving through yellow ribbon weekends.

                                One of Debby's favorite mottos is "you have to do what you don't want to do because it is what you and your body need." That's why you'll
                                always find a creative deep core component in her vinyasa classes and by the time it is over, you'll be smiling.

                                Debbie Kephart (E-RYT 200) completed her 200-hour teacher training in 2003 with Wendy Gross at The Yoga & Healing Center. A former
                                athlete, she first fell in love with the physical benefits of yoga and enjoyed the benefits it lent to her enjoying her sports (golf and
                                paddle tennis) and coaching (high school and youth lacrosse). She then discovered the healing practice of restorative yoga and continued
                                her education studying with Judith Lasater in 2011 and then furthered her studies with Jillian Pransky in 2014 (Minimal Prop) and 2017
                                (Restorative Therapeutics). She hopes to do Jillian's Therapeutic Training this December (2019). Debbie also obtained her 30hr Yin
                                Certification with Sarah Bodner this past fall (2018), after enjoying several yin workshops offered at Bhakti Barn. She teaches Mindful
                                Flow classes as well as Restorative and Yin. Debbie encourages her students to use props to work with THEIR bodies for their best
                                alignment, in their now. She loves the team and community at Bhakti Barn- and all the love & glitter there too. Shanti shanti shanti.

                                Andre has been a yoga teacher on various levels at Integral Yoga Institute in Manhattan since 2000. Forever grateful to wonderful teachers
                                who are pioneers in many fields of yoga: Kali Morse and Swami Ramananda for training in the beginning and intermediate asanas and
                                pranayama, Hamsa Spagnola for training in gentle yoga/ chair, Swami Karunananda for meditation training.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In the last few years, Andre found inspiration in the therapeutic aspect of yoga. He completed the first level of Creative Yoga Therapy
                                with Nina Priya David, basic and advanced Yoga Therapy with Cheri Clampett and Arturo Peal.

                            <p>
                                Restorative yoga classes that Andre teaches are part of yoga therapy. They enhance regular Hatha practice but can also be an excellent
                                introduction to yoga for individuals of all ages who may feel shy to participate in regular yoga classes.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Since 2017 Andre is certified by the International Association of Yoga Therapists (C-IATY) to work a one-on-one basis as the yoga
                                therapist. Hiking, biking, and yoga are the best stress management tools in Andre’s toolbox with yoga being available all the time when he
                                breathes and connects with his inner - self.

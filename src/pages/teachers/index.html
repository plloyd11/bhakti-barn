                                Vanessa’s own yoga journey began in 2003 when, on the eve of her NYU theatrical directorial debut, she was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Yoga empowered her to
                                play a role in her own healing process. Since returning to health, she’s dedicated herself to educating others and supporting her students’ empowerment through the

                                Varrita started her journey of yoga 10 years ago. After finishing a competitive gymnastics career she was left with chronic back and joint pain. Looking for a form a
                                movement that was strong and fluid yet more subtle then gymnastics, she began yoga. Through yoga Varrita learned how to manage her pain and anxiety. This was life
                                changing and opened many doors. Varrita loves teaching movement, she was a competitive gymnastics coach for many years and decided it was time to teach yoga in 2012.

                                It is truer to say Kundalini Yoga found Trish, rather than the other way around. From her first experience in class, Trish knew Kundalini was for her. She loved the
                                music, the meditations and the way it worked for everybody. It felt like coming home. Trish's spiritual name is Ravi Kirtan Kaur and through life's many ups and downs
                                Kundalini has been a stabilizing force for healing, a practice for life.

                                In 2004 Trish got certified to teach at Kundalini Yoga East in NYC under the guidance of Sat Jivan Kaur and Sat Jivan Singh and has been teaching ever since. Trish
                                completed level 2 Mind and Meditation Kundalini training in New Mexico in 2018 and will continue with level 2 Stress and Vitality in 2019. Her goal is to complete all
                                five-level 2 trainings. Trish will be forever grateful to Yogi Bhajan for sharing such an uplifting practice and for the loving support of the Kundalini community.

                                When not teaching yoga Trish works as a school nurse in Millburn, enjoys time with her three children and can be found hiking and taking photographs. Trish loves to

                                "I came to yoga, like so many, for the physical benefits- strength, flexibility, general well-being. What I found was so much more- a way of seeing myself and the world
                                more clearly, a way to calm and still my mind. Yoga has helped me link mind, body, and spirit, using the breath. It provides a system for clearing space- both in the
                                body and in the mind. I am forever grateful to Betsy Davis (Betsy-ma!) for her generosity and for creating a loving home in Bhakti Barn.”

                                One of Steve’s earliest encounters with these sacred practices came at a very young age. As a child, his favorite movie was the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In it,
                                there are scenes when the Turtles sit and meditate, and although the movie is full of action and adventure, these scenes captured a deeper part of his attention and
                                curiosity. Seeds were planted, and only when he began practicing meditation almost 20 years later, did he realize that he’d been storing them in the depths of his mind
                                since childhood, and now was the time to cultivate. After a few months of meditation practice, sitting comfortably was, well…not so comfortable. At this time, Steve’s
                                study of eastern philosophy was burgeoning and through this study he noticed that yoga was also mentioned quite frequently along with meditation. It was clear that this
                                was the next step and before long he began taking classes at Naturally Yoga in Glen Rock, NJ.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Since then, he has studied in the traditions of Intergral Yoga, Iyengar, and Ashtanga yoga, infusing all three into his personal practice and always keeping meditation
                                as the cornerstone. In 2016, he completed his 200 hour teacher training at Naturally Yoga and considers Veronica Yacco, Neil and Sheryl Edsall as the well springs from
                                which he has been blessed with these teachings. Steve believes that in this life, the body and mind are the instruments with which we’ve been given to perform, and
                                yogic practices are how we tune them.

                                Stephanie has always been an extremely active, passionate and expressive person. She was first introduced to yoga at the tender age of 18 when a trusted teacher
                                recommended it to help keep her active and mindful while healing her various dance injuries. After one class she was hooked!

                                Stephanie completed her 200 hour yoga teacher training in early 2014 at Bhakti Barn Yoga. Through her training she gained a stronger relationship with herself while
                                also acquiring the skills and education to become an informed and deeply invested yoga teacher. She has also completed various additional trainings including Aerial
                                Yoga certification from OM factory NYC and Kids yoga modules from Grounded Kids Yoga. She is constantly striving to hone not only her own personal practice, but also
                                her skills as an educator/communicator while honoring Yogas historic roots. She thoroughly believes in the healing and strengthening powers the introspection of yoga
                                can provide, and she is thrilled to be able to share her love of this practice with the community!

                                Magda was introduced to yoga at a young age by her family and has been going classes and kirtans ever since. She dove deeper into her practice in 2010 to find anxiety
                                relief from the stresses and pressures of daily life. Once she found the benefits of bringing breath and movement into the body she could never look back. Her classes
                                include mindful alignment with a playful sequence of poses. She strives to make each class unique and help every body experience yoga to their fullest potential: the
                                mind, body, and spirit connection.

                                made big impression and I completed Level 1 and 2 under Jamie Lynn Skolnick of Laughing Lotus Yoga NY. I believe that practice of yoga brings joy and should be
                                accessible to all who wish to participate. Gentle yoga was logical next step and I took training with Stephanie Haberman in Bhakti Barn yoga. Also, I completed training
                                in Yin Yoga. The correct dose of everything to create joy and satisfaction what I try to bring into each class. I am grateful to Betsy Davis, Stephanie Haberman and

                                Debby Kaminsky is a former advertising executive who decided in 2006 she wanted to sell the benefits of transformation. She took her first yoga class in 1997 while her
                                twins were in pre-school. Feeling great, she never turned back, becoming a yoga instructor in 2004 through a 500-hour certification at the Samudra School of Living Yoga
                                with her friend and yoga guide, Shiva Rea.

                                life skills through important breathing and yoga with 32,000+ students, 5000+ educators, and the Newark community, including firefighters. She also teaches Veterans
                                yoga through Kula for Karma with the honor of bringing yoga to all armed services personnel in NJ returning from serving through yellow ribbon weekends.

                                core component in her vinyasa classes and by the time it is over, you'll be smiling.

                                Debbie Kephart (E-RYT 200) completed her 200-hour teacher training in 2003 with Wendy Gross at The Yoga & Healing Center. A former athlete, she first fell in love with
                                the physical benefits of yoga and enjoyed the benefits it lent to her enjoying her sports (golf and paddle tennis) and coaching (high school and youth lacrosse). She
                                then discovered the healing practice of restorative yoga and continued her education studying with Judith Lasater in 2011 and then furthered her studies with Jillian
                                Pransky in 2014 (Minimal Prop) and 2017 (Restorative Therapeutics). She hopes to do Jillian's Therapeutic Training this December (2019). Debbie also obtained her 30hr
                                Yin Certification with Sarah Bodner this past fall (2018), after enjoying several yin workshops offered at Bhakti Barn. She teaches Mindful Flow classes as well as
                                Restorative and Yin. Debbie encourages her students to use props to work with THEIR bodies for their best alignment, in their now. She loves the team and community at
                                Bhakti Barn- and all the love & glitter there too. Shanti shanti shanti.

                                Andre has been a yoga teacher on various levels at Integral Yoga Institute in Manhattan since 2000. Forever grateful to wonderful teachers who are pioneers in many
                                fields of yoga: Kali Morse and Swami Ramananda for training in the beginning and intermediate asanas and pranayama, Hamsa Spagnola for training in gentle yoga/ chair,
                                Swami Karunananda for meditation training.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In the last few years, Andre found inspiration in the therapeutic aspect of yoga. He completed the first level of Creative Yoga Therapy with Nina Priya David, basic and
                                advanced Yoga Therapy with Cheri Clampett and Arturo Peal.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Restorative yoga classes that Andre teaches are part of yoga therapy. They enhance regular Hatha practice but can also be an excellent introduction to yoga for
                                individuals of all ages who may feel shy to participate in regular yoga classes.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Since 2017 Andre is certified by the International Association of Yoga Therapists (C-IATY) to work a one-on-one basis as the yoga therapist. Hiking, biking, and yoga
                                are the best stress management tools in Andre’s toolbox with yoga being available all the time when he breathes and connects with his inner - self.

                                Vanessa Burkly holds her BFA in Fashion Design, with a specialization in Sportswear Apparel, from the Fashion Institute of Technology. Practicing yoga for five years
                                led her to receive her 200-hour Registered Yoga Teaching Certificate in Hatha Yoga at the Bhakti Barn School of Yoga in Millburn, New Jersey in March of 2018. She
                                strives to encourage her fellow students to be kind, present, patient and to also challenge themselves. What resonates most for her is that yoga can be integrated into
                                everyday life. She currently works at School of Rock Hoboken as a Studio Coordinator, and she is also a Freelance Artist.

                                Sherri took her first yoga class 10 years ago and has been on a journey of self-discovery ever since. As a trained classical musician, she feels especially tuned into
                                the ebb and flow of breath and places special emphasis on its connection to alignment during class. Sherri is a Himalayan Singing Bowl practitioner and avid gardener
                                and calls upon both to inform her classes. She is passionate about connecting yoga and sound to produce a moving meditation, so her classes combine asana, mantra,
                                nature imagery, breath work and sound vibration to find balance, focus and stillness. Sherri received her 200 hr RYT certification in March 2019 at Bhakti Barn under
                                the guidance of Betsy Davis and Lauren Magarelli and also completed advanced singing bowl training at the Atma Buti Vibrational Sound School in November 2018.

                                Jordan first come to yoga as a means of supporting her long distance running and quickly fell in love with the practice that changed both her body and mind. Through
                                life, career, and relationship changes, yoga offered a source of strength, space, clarity, and much needed peace. With a deep desire to share all that yoga had given
                                her, Jordan completed her 200-hour YTT with teachers Betsy Davis, Vanessa Nassif, and Lauren Magarelli at Bhakti Barn Yoga in 2019. Much like Jordan, students should
                                expect her classes to be upbeat and dynamic - incorporating creative sequencing and drills to leave them feeling balanced, alert, and strong. When not teaching Jordan
                                runs a boutique graphic design business specializing in data visualization for healthcare and academia. A Brooklyn-expat, Jordan now lives in Caldwell with her husband
                                and two children. Jordan bows in gratitude to each of her teachers, but especially Theo, who teaches her that life is full of wonder and invention; and Poppy, whose
                                love of movement is a continuous fountain of inspiration.

                                Vianora fell in love with yoga 15 years ago in a tiny studio of the industrial area of Queens. She is immensely grateful to her first teacher, Danielle Lee, whose
                                teachings healed, uplifted, and put her on the path of yoga. She remembers Danielle connecting effortlessly with people in the room through her positive spirit,
                                carefully chosen poetry and inspiring dharma talks. It is an approach Vianora aims to carry on in her classes today.

                                Vianora completed her 200 hour Vinyasa Teacher Training with Laughing Lotus in NYC and her 50 hour Ayurveda training with Bhakti Barn in NJ. She feels deep gratitude
                                for having been guided and inspired by teachers Dana Trixie Flynn, Joanne Silver and Niika Quistgard. She is also a two-time NY Emmy nominated producer who's
                                passionately worked on numerous stories about the environment, health, spirituality and personal life journeys. Strongly focusing on breath and inward awareness,
                                Vianora's yoga classes flow light-heartedly through an asana practice that always encourages listening to your body. Classically trained in playing the piano and with a
                                general passion for music and the therapy of sound, Vianora carefully curates each class' playlist to be in synch with the day's flow and our shared spirit of
                                wellbeing.

                                Her lifelong passion for working with children led to a career in kids’ marketing and advertising and an MFA in Creative Writing for Children, yet she knew she had a
                                higher and more meaningful purpose in connecting with and inspiring kids. Always an active, competitive athlete, Naomi came to the mat for the physical practice when
                                her own kids were very young, with no idea how the emotional and spiritual aspects of yoga would transform and ignite her life. She decided to combine her love of yoga
                                with her dedication to kids’ wellness, and became a children’s yoga instructor, introducing kids and teens to the lifelong emotional and physical benefits of the
                                practice.

                                Naomi brings a playful, accessible and “unplugged” approach to her classes, showing her students how yoga is a non-competitive, non-judgmental practice for everybody
                                and every BODY that goes far beyond the asana. Particularly in these times of constant technology, screen addiction and increasing rates of anxiety, Naomi is committed
                                to demystifying the myths of yoga, which so often show up as sleek, curated images on Instagram.

                                When not teaching yoga, Naomi runs The Write Fit, a nonprofit female empowerment program she created in 2011, which combines yoga and other types of movement with
                                journal writing to inspire positive self-talk, body awareness, compassion, expression and confidence.

                                Jill has been practicing yoga for over 10 years. Always a physically active person, Jill turned to yoga when she was looking for something more than the typical gym
                                routine. What she found was a form of exercise that left her feeling physically and spiritually lifted. Practicing yoga has become her most reliable stress reliever as
                                she muddles through the “sandwich” years.

                                In 2016, Jill completed her 200 hour YTT at Bhakti Barn, looking to share the benefits of yoga with others. Since then she has been teaching Basics, alignment based
                                vinyasa yoga, incorporating pranayama and yin yoga into her classes. Guiding her students through a purposeful practice, developing awareness and individual practice.

                                Maryellen’s relationship with yoga began in her mid-20’s, initially inspired by her own personal journey as a physical therapy patient with chronic back issues. After
                                several years of steady practice and pain relief, she was motivated to become certified through Bhakti Barn Yoga, becoming a RYT-200 in March 2016. Her background and
                                experience advocating as a mental health practitioner, combined with her passion for sharing the benefits of integrating asanas and pranayama to help calm body and mind
                                has led her to teaching Gentle Yoga at our Glen Ridge studio three times a week. Maryellen is eternally grateful to Betsy Davis for inspiring her continued search for
                                Svadhyaya, encouraging her to participate in Bhakti Barn’s pilot 300-hour RYT and receiving her certification in June 0f 2018. When not on her yoga mat, Maryellen can
                                be found singing rock n' roll with her husband in a local cover band, designing and making jewelry, and helping her teenage daughter develop her own creative passions
                                as a performing artist.

                                Samantha finished her 500-hour YTT at Jaipure Yoga in Montclair, NJ with teachers Loryn Riggiola and Marcie Wallace. With the recent discovery that she has a form of
                                joint hypermobility syndrome, Samantha's practice and teaching strives to come from a place of stability and precision, without sacrificing the imagination, fun, and
                                self-exploration of a vinyasa practice. You can expect a challenging, yet light-hearted, creative, and well-rounded class that engages both mind and body.

                                Kaity, RYT-200, completed her training with Betsy Davis and Lauren Magarelli and received her certification from Bhakti Barn Yoga. She first stumbled into the world of
                                yoga in 2007 as a high schooler in desperate need of some big picture perspective and a good stretch. The physical practice quickly became a passion for her. Time and
                                again yoga has served as a way for Kaity to come back to center and through her training and teaching she has found a true love for sharing yoga with others.

                                From a young age, Angela found movement and music to be way of self-expression. She danced ballet, tap, jazz and hip hop for 15 years. She also taught dance for 5 years
                                and played piano for 7 years. When she experienced her first yoga class with both mantra and asana, the experience and blissful feeling afterwards had her hooked.
                                Angela settled into her first yoga pose in 2013. Since then, a combination of physical yoga and meditation has played an instrumental role in her daily life. It teaches
                                her balance and patience, while aiding in her constant determination to stay centered and focused, on and off the mat.

                                expand her service skills to another level by completing her Integrated Energy Therapy and Reiki 2 training in 2016 and 200 hour yoga teacher training at Bhakti Barn
                                Yoga in 2017. As a teacher, she is passionate in creating a deeper awareness of breath and space with those who take her energetic yet calm classes. Her intention is to
                                provide guidance in the evolution of who you are into who you want to become. Angela’s dedication to her own practice supports her desire to assist others on their

                                Liz Pagan’s style of teaching reflects her belief that our intelligence is not limited to our minds but extends into the very cells of our bodies -- and that body
                                awareness is an integral component of self-realization. In the discipline of hatha yoga we go more and more deeply into ourselves, layer by layer.

                            <p>
                                In fact, Liz has been known to say, “yoga is like an onion.” Yoga not only has many layers like an onion, but sometimes it’s sweet, and sometimes it brings tears. So
                                she approaches her practice, and her teaching, with kindness and humor.

                                Liz began studying yoga in1990. She credits her commitment to yoga and affinity for the method of Mr. Iyengar to Susan Wilson, with whom she studied for more than a
                                decade. She took a brief detour and earned a 200-hour certification in the Anusara tradition. She then returned to the Iyengar fold and completed a 500-plus-hour
                                Teacher Workshop program at Studio Yoga Madison, and received her Introductory II Iyengar Yoga certification. She has participated in many intensives with senior
                                teachers including Kofi Busia, Gabriella Giubilaro, Joan White, Sri Arun and Roger Cole.

                                Galina started practicing yoga in 2003. At the time she was dealing with some health issues and a lot of stress. Yoga practice brought clarity and mindfulness into her
                                life, taught her to take care of physical, mental and emotional health, and helped her to connect to inner self and find strong inner core. After 13 years of
                                incorporating yoga into her life she decided to undergo yoga teacher training to deepen the practice. In March 2016 Galina obtained a Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT 200h)
                                certificate from Bhakti Barn yoga studio in Millburn under the guidance of Betsy Davis and Lauren Magarelli. Since November 2017 she has been working on her advanced
                                RYT 500h. In July 2017 Galina received a certificate in Kurma Restorative yoga from Dhyana Yoga Arts studio in Chester NJ. She mostly specializes in vinyasa yoga,
                                gentle yoga, restorative yoga and alignment based flow yoga.

                                “I like the idea of yoga for everyone, all people can find something magical in yoga that they can benefit from: whether it is meditation, breathing, physical postures
                                or Savasana.” Galina arranges classes in a playful manner trying to add some humor and some joy to the practice. She is always eager to learn or absorb something new.
                                Yoga keeps life intriguing, challenging, interesting, inspiring and unpredictable! “ I will carry on to explore the path of yoga by continuing to train, connecting with
                                other people, learning new meditation skills, being flexible and strong on and especially off the floor. Most importantly, I will keep sharing my knowledge, my skills,

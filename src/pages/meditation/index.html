                                    In this 30 Minute class, you will be guided in Mindfulness Meditation. With a focus on the breath, the practice will bring us into the present moment, strengthen
                                    our concentration, and allow our body and mind to rest right here, right now. By stopping, focusing on our breathing and observing our thoughts, feelings, and
                                    sensations, we gain clarity, spaciousness and the ability to stay present to whatever arises without reacting habitually. By practicing with the support of
                                    community, our commitment to living mindfully is strengthened.

                                    This guided meditation will focus on a few techniques to quiet the mind and offer a greater sense of well being. Breath awareness, heart opening loving kindness and
                                    gratitude will be some of the touchstones for this 30 minute class.

                                    Through gentle guided meditation, we’ll explore how to actually “be" present in each passing moment, noticing when judgement of the inner critic arises, and
                                    learning how we might gently let these unskillful qualities drop away to make space for attributes such as kindness, patience, acceptance and compassion.

                                    The practice of mindfulness leads to the development of a clear, contented mind; one that comes to understand that happiness and peace aren't found in outside
                                    circumstances, but lie within us, just waiting to be awakened. In this class, we will explore a number of different formal mindfulness meditation practices, then
                                    follow with a discussion of how we might take the practice off the cushion and into everyday life.

                                    There are many misconceptions around the idea and practice of meditation. Through practices and techniques, we will demystify meditation to facilitate discovery of
                                    what works in each moment. Each class will focus on these techniques: breath work, visualization, sound (inner and outer), and silence. This class welcomes both
                                    beginners and experienced practitioners.

                                    Tai Chi has been called "Meditation in Motion" and is beneficial for health (especially stress reduction), meditation and self defense. Tai Chi is an ancient
                                    Chinese art involving a series of movements performed in a slow, focused manner accompanied by deep breathing. In Tai Chi we use the philosophy of the Taoist Yin
                                    Yang to balance ourselves and use "pushing hands" with a partner (Tui Shou) to understand our relationship in the universe. The class commences with meditation to
                                    ready the body for practice. Then a series of Qigong exercises are done to balance our energies. The main focus of the class is then practicing the Tai Chi form
                                    (Yang form), continually learning more movements. followed by Tui Shou (pushing hands) and finishing with a meditation. (wear loose, comfortable clothing)

                                    Qi Gong is an ancient Chinese Art using movement, visualization and Healing sounds to cultivate and move life force energy known as “Qi”. Loosely translated “Qi
                                    Gong” means “Energy Cultivation”. Mike has found Qi Gong to be one of the most effective and efficient ways to put the body mind and spirit into alignment to
                                    promote Health and Healing.

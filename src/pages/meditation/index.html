                                <p>In this 30 Minute class, you will be guided in Mindfulness Meditation. With a focus on the breath, the practice will bring us into the present moment, strengthen our
                                    concentration, and allow our body and mind to rest right here, right now. By stopping, focusing on our breathing and observing our thoughts, feelings, and sensations, we

                                    circumstances, but lie within us, just waiting to be awakened. In this class, we
                                    will explore a number of different formal mindfulness meditation practices, then
                                    follow with a discussion of how we might take the practice off the cushion and into
